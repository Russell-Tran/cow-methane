## Research Proposal: Achieve ***Agrobacterium***-mediated genetic transformation of red macroalgae ***Asparagopsis taxiformis***
12 May 2021


_Asparagopsis taxiformis_ is a common red macroalgae (seaweed) native to Australia, southeast Asia, and southern California, among other regions, especially the warm-water tropics. In fact, it is sufficiently common that it is an invasive species in other parts of the world, such as off the Iberian Peninsula/Spain.


Someone should achieve _Agrobacterium_-mediated genetic transformation of _Asparagopsis taxiformis_ as part of building a toolkit to enable engineering the species and other red macroalgae. A broadly reliable protocol to genetically transform macroalgae does not yet exist, and the use of modern tools like CRISPR has not been achieved either (Mikami 2014, Ramessur et al. 2018).


### Background


_A. taxiformis_ does not have a history of commercial cultivation. At most, it has been wild harvested in Hawaii as a delicacy. However, the species has been gaining attention as a potential climate change breakthrough in its use as a feed supplement to prevent enteric methanogenesis in cattle and other ruminant livestock. Namely, 1% of feed by mass of _Asparagopsis_ has shown to reduce _in vivo_ methane emissions from cows by 70-90%. Cow methane production is one of the largest contributors to anthropogenic climate change.[^1] The mechanism for inhibiting gut bacteria methanogenesis is due to _A. taxiformis_’s relatively high secondary metabolite concentration of bromoform and bromoform-like compounds (aka halogenated methane analogues - HMAs), which block some of the pathway enzymes. (Evolutionarily, some algae produce bromoform as a latent defense against microbes). Being able to genetically modify _A. taxiformis_ would facilitate study of the species and accelerate its domestication.


Preexisting literature reviews can be found [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7766277/), [here](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2020.597430/full), and [here](https://stud.epsilon.slu.se/13616/). But generally, I have been able to gauge the 7-year chronology and summarize the research as follows:



* Canadian farmer hypothesizes that his cows grazing along the beach might be healthier because of seaweed in their diet[^2]


* Australian microbiologists take up the hypothesis and test the effect of various alga on cow gut microbiota _in vitro_. Unintentionally discover that addition of _Asparagopsis taxiformis_ prevents virtually all (99%) methane emissions from their samples (Machado et al. 2016)
* Research of the seaweed continues in Australia across University of Sunshine Coast, CSIRO, James Cook University. Eg, small livestock trials, study on suspension of seaweed in vegetable oil to prevent decay of bromoform vs freeze drying (Magnusson et al. 2020) 
* Australian aquaculture company (Australis Aquaculture/Greener Grazing) tries to cultivate the seaweed in its farms in Vietnam. Starts a seed bank of _A. taxiformis_ geographic varieties, and other characterizations[^3]


* A startup (Blue Ocean Barns) evangelizes research in California, securing funding for experiments on cattle at UC Davis and cultivation research at UC San Diego 
* UC Davis (147 day trial) and Penn State research reliably show _in vivo_ methane reduction of 80-98% using only 1-2% _A. taxiformis_ in feed by mass. No negative impact on cattle health, milk production, or milk flavor, and no bromoform detected in milk or tissues (Roque et al. 2020)
* Other studies on the East Coast and in New Zealand confirm methane reduction in sheep[^4] 


* Another UCSD researcher examines native California seaweeds in hopes of finding other species similar to _A. taxiformis_ in bromoform production[^5]


* Different startup (Symbrosia) attempts to cultivate the seaweed in Hawaii[^6]

At the moment, the success of this seaweed in cows is hindered by economic feasibility and the need to achieve a planetary scale-up of currently nonexistent aquaculture infrastructure for _A. taxiformis_. Vijin et al. (2020) calculate that 3-3.4 million metric tons of seaweed (dry mass) per year is necessary for the 1% inclusion in feed level to support the 93 million cattle in the United States, which is half the current global seaweed output. They do not even bother to calculate the requisite seaweed mass for the total 1.4 billion cows on Earth. There exists further speculation that the bromoform-based methanogenesis inhibition may fail in the long term if the gut microbiota simply adapt (Hristov at a conference, 2019).


Because of these scaling issues, I have wondered for quite some time why one would not simply use synthetic bromoform, which is already on the market as an industrial product. I am not fully satisfied with the answers I have found so far, an important caveat to resolve before I begin the proposed research project. Tomkins et al. (2009) showed a 93% reduction in cattle methane using synthetic bromochloromethane at a dose rate of 0.30 g/100 kg LW, but with the disclaimer “The experiments reported here were completed in 2004 before the Australian Government prohibited the manufacture and use of BCM”.[^7] There is also some ambiguity about the carcinogenicity of bromoform. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) says bromoform is not a human carcinogen, whereas the EPA classifies it as a probable human carcinogen (Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry). As alluded in the above bullets, there have thus far been no measurable health issues from a 147 day trial (Roque et al. 2021). Per advice I received from an _Asparagopsis_ cultivation startup about synthetic bromoform, “[1] pure bromoform does not have the full nutritional profile of the algae and [2] instead causes gas build up in the stomach of the animal, making them think they are full and thus they stop eating. Else, [3] it would be extremely difficult/impossible to get regulatory approval to feed synthetic bromoform to livestock” (numbering mine). [1] is a commercial reason, and [3] might demonstrate the useful role of _A. taxiformis_ as a perception “wrapper” or “Trojan horse” of sorts for bromoform, but [2] is not self-explanatory and I currently do not have an answer for it and how the distinction is caused by _A. taxiformis_.


Suppose _A. taxiformis_ as consumed by the cow is in fact more viable than isolated/synthetic bromoform.[^8] Then we are back to the economic problem, for which I imagine two possible bioengineering solutions. The first is that we would want to engineer _taxiformis_ into a truly valuable livestock feed supplement by adding or enhancing other features of the seaweed. Feed supplements today make use of brown seaweed (kelp and rockweed, _Laminariales_ and _A. nodosum_) in powdered form because of its nutrient content, etc. (Makkar et al. 2016 cited by Vijin 2020). There is evidence that the methanogenic inhibition by _A. taxiformis_ in cows may improve energy utilization from feed because the enteric methanogenic pathway is of no metabolic use to cows (hydrogen metabolism to propionate production) (Kinley et al. 2020 cited by Vijin 2020). This is one way in which the seaweed may be economically useful to farmers on its own. We would want to further this by making _A. taxiformis_ into a superior feed supplement by engineering its nutrient content to outperform kelp and rockweed. The second solution is that if cultivation of _A. taxiformis_ still fails to be economically viable, then continue with the prior strategy but move the bromoform and nutrient production to a different biological chassis, such as spirulina or _Pichia_, and sell that as the supplement. 


I assumed genetic engineering of macroalgae was well-established because the federal government and oil companies have invested heavily in microalgae biofuel research, and algae biofuels were a notorious poster child of biotechnology in the 2000s.[^9] But macroalgae engineering is more analogous to plant engineering, and tracks behind it in progress (Ramessur et al. 2018). Per the review by Mikami (2014), if you want to genetically modify seaweed, there are 4 steps that have to be solved:



1. “creating expression constructs particularly suited to seaweed cells;
2. transferring the expression constructs into cells;
3. ensuring integration of expression constructs into the genome; and
4. selecting genetically transformed cells.”

For macroalgae species other than _A. taxiformis_: (1) has already been solved. (2) has worked via particle bombardment, microinjection, and _Agrobacterium_ for various species, but not yet electroporation or glass beads. Mikami’s experiments showed that glass bead methods did not work.


One might be encouraged to try _Agrobacterium_ transformation because it is cost effective compared to the alternatives and thus more likely to become a tool if it works.[^10] 


The red macroalgae species that have been transformed by _Agrobacterium_ thus far are _Pyropia yezoensis_ (Cheney et al. 2001),[^11] _Gracilaria changii_ (Gan et al. 2005 cited by Ramessur 2018), _Kappaphycus alvarezii_ (Handayani et al. 2014 cited by Ramessur 2018; Triana et al. 2016 cited by Ramessur 2018),  and _Chondrus crispus _(Ramessur et al. 2018). As a novice, I would have my methodology heavily rely on the methodology provided in Ramessur et al. 2018. The research would consist largely of reproducing the methodology to see if it works in _A. taxiformis_. The paper is a wellspring of useful idiosyncrasies that are useful to successful _Agrobacterium_-seaweed transformation, such as the importance of a transformation environment which is agreeable to both species. For instance, they used the LBA4404 strain of _Agrobacterium_ because it is comparatively salt-tolerant. For the marine unicellular algae _Parachlorella kessleri_, Rathod et al. (2013) had to use the freshwater medium TAP because both _P. kessleri_ and _Agrobacterium_ could tolerate the salinity level, so this consideration is common. Ramessur et al. were also able to report transformation of _Chondrus_ _crispus_ with needle wounding without the external application of acetosyringone, implying that _Chondrus crispus_ releases its own phenolics when wounded. It would be interesting to observe whether _A. taxiformis_ releases its own phenolics as well.


Lastly, a genome of _A. taxiformis_ has not yet been published to GenBank. At present, there are only sequences for its plastid and mitochondria.[^12]_ _A low-hanging fruit to get started would be to sequence its genome. 


### Considerations


Failure to cultivate the specimen will significantly kneecap progress. 


Because _A. taxiformis_ does not have a prior history of cultivation, best practices for cultivation are not common knowledge. As recent as 2019, the life cycle of the species had not yet been completed in captivity (stuck in the sporophyte phase).[^13] Currently, at least 1 company claims to have completed the life cycle, though that information may be proprietary.[^14] Replication can still be achieved in the sporophyte phase through fragmentation of the specimen, but it is unknown whether other phases might be more amenable to genetic transformation.

     Other synthetic compounds were also tried on ruminants for methanogenesis inhibition before _A. taxiformis_ appeared on the radar: chloroform and chloral hydrate, which resulted in varying degrees of liver and blood cell damage, toxicity, and death (Patra cited by Silwer, 2011). 

[^8]:
     For instance, no work has been done so far to decouple the efficacy of the other bromoform-like compounds from _A. taxiformis_ (tease out any synergies that exist) such that _A. taxiformis_ as consumed by the cow is holistically more performant than just synthetic bromoform. Or _A. taxiformis_ is like the coating on a pill for better delivery.
